summary: GPU-accelerated system capable of providing simulation of light transport in an optical tomography imaging system.

We have presented a novel GPU-accelerated light transport simulator for OT systems applied to two-phase flows.
<br/>
We argue that traditional hard-field tomography reconstruction methods are not well suited for OT imaging of two-phase flows. Therefore, we propose that a new solution can be found via direct problem modeling
<br/>
The development of a reliable reconstruction for OT might spread the use of this technique
<br/>
Furthermore, data fusion might allow for next-generation nonintrusive process tomography if OT is to be used in tandem with other non-intrusive industrial tomographic modalities such as electrical or ultrasound tomography systems
