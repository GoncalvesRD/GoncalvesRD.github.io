<br/>
This system allows information to be viewed within a context of proximity and centrality, based on Natural Language Processing, Cluster Analysis and Network Analysis. The tweets are grouped in a way that makes it possible to identify the composition of sub-groups, which represent the different topics being treated on the network.
<br/>
<br/>
This project is a development of the [*Leadr Tweet Classifier*](https://goncalvesrd.github.io/projects/tclassifier).
